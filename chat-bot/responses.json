        "message": "FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be easy to use and to help developers build robust and performant APIs quickly. Here are some key features of FastAPI:\n\n1. **High Performance**: FastAPI is one of the fastest Python frameworks available, as it is built on top of Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts. It is designed to be as fast as possible, allowing you to build APIs that are ready for production.\n\n2. **Automatic Interactive API Documentation**: FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation using Swagger UI and ReDoc. This makes it easy for developers and users to understand and interact with the API.\n\n3. **Based on Standards**: It is built on standards like OpenAPI (for API creation) and JSON Schema (for data validation). This ensures compatibility with a wide range of tools and libraries.\n\n4. **Type Hints and Validation**: FastAPI leverages Python type hints to validate, serialize, and deserialize data, ensuring that the data your API consumes and produces is correct. This also aids in the development by providing editor support for type checking and autocompletion.\n\n5. **Dependency Injection**: FastAPI provides a simple and intuitive way to declare dependencies, which helps in creating reusable components and managing application complexity.\n\n6. **Asynchronous Support**: It has native support for asynchronous programming, allowing you to build asynchronous endpoints using Python's `async` and `await` syntax.\n\n7. **Security and Authentication**: FastAPI includes tools and patterns to handle security and authentication, including OAuth2 with JWT tokens, API key security, and more.\n\n8. **Extensible**: It is designed to be easily extended and can be integrated with a variety of databases, authentication providers, and other tools.\n\nOverall, FastAPI is highly suitable for projects that require high performance and scalability, such as web applications, microservices, or machine learning model serving. Its ease of use and automatic documentation make it a popular choice among developers for building APIs in Python."
